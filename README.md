# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

Based on the summary dataframe for ridesharing, there are many more rides for urban cities compared to suburban or rural cities. In addition, the total drivers and total fares are higher for urban cities compared to suburban or rural cities. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is higher in rural cities compared to suburban and urban cities. This may show that the rural trips may have taken longer compared to suburban and urban cities and there were more rides than available drivers in rural cities.

Based on the multiple-line chart, the total fare by city type is higher for urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. In addition, the total fares stays relatively consistent throughout the four-month period with some slight fluctuations. 

## Summary
Three business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types:

1. Increase the number of drivers available in rural cities to meet the number of rides requested
2. Determine additional data including length of rides and demographics such as age and population to group fares by length of rides, age, and population with city type
3. Determine additional data for the entire year to see if there may be any trends during certain months of the year where the total fare by city type might drop and see if there is a way to incentivize additional drivers during those months of lower activity
